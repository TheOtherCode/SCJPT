Hi everyone!

Ever wondered what exactly, AND how much work Supreme Court judges are doing?
More than 4 crore cases pending in all courts of India.
In such a scenario, it is imperative that the work of judges is quantitatively analysed.

This program seeks to fetch and present the amount of work done by present sitting judges in the Supreme Court.
This code access data available on {https://main.sci.gov.in/} and specifically, {https://main.sci.gov.in/daily-order}

Once the data is fetched, the same is presented in a excel sheet.
[Please look at the attached excel sheet, to get a sense of the method of organisation]


I understand this may not be making sense to a lot of people interested.
I will try to soon prepare wither a dashboard or an .exe file, which will make running/using the code straightforward.
Till then I hope this code is able to help atleast those, who know how to run it.

For any comments, suggestions, feedback OR in case you may have faced any problem in running the code
get in touch:-
